# Cinema-Room-Manager
Create cinema theatre where we can buy tickets, show the seats and see statistics.
Menu should look like this:

1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit

When the item Statistics is chosen, program should print the following information:
The number of purchased tickets;
The number of purchased tickets represented as a percentage. Percentages should be rounded to 2 decimal places;
Current income;
The total income that shows how much money the theatre will get if all the tickets are sold.

Program shouldn't allow to user to buy a ticket that has already been purchased and warning user when put incorrect place in theatre.
When theatre has places more than 60 there is different price: 10$ for the front half of the rows and 8$ for the back half. In other cases the price is 10$.
Zap!
